# NBA-Statistical-Analysis
### Statistical analysis on NBA datasets using data sets off of Kaggle.com
###### Written in R, using RStudio.

The NBA implemented the now integral three-point line in the 1979-1980 season, in its early years it was never seen as a very important part of the game however over the years players like Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, and Stephen Curry have revolutionized the game of basketball to the point where 3-point shooting is so crucial towards winning that even Centers have now learned to shoot from 3. In this project we will analyze the increase in popularity and how important they are to win. Alongside this we will also be analyzing different metrics which may impact winning in the NBA.
